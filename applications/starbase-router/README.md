# starbase-router

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

### Dependancy

vue-router - for multipage app
npm install vue-router --save

### Improvements

* Allow the user to specify their own list of initial_ids rather than hard-coding the [1.13.14] array or list of ids that you chose to go with

* Add another route for vehicles from the api
