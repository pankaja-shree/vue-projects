# starbase

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Improvements 

* Add a back button which allows the user to revert their last switch character. That way, they can save a character they may have liked that they accidentally skipped over.

* Keep a history of all the characters that the user generates in the lifespan of the application.
