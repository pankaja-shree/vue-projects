## Application -1: Notes App

Ways to improve: 

* Add a color property to each note that allows you to sort notes according to color.

* Add a priority number to each note, that allows you to rank the priority of notes.

* Use ###a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sfcookies">this package for cookies in order to keep a history of notes through browser cookies. This way, if a user refreshes the app, they will find notes that they previously stored.
